# Toguz Kumalak ("nine pebbles")
##### Toguz Kumalak ("nine pebbles") is the Kazakh name of a Mancala game also known as Toguz Korgool ("nine dung balls") in Kyrgyz. The number 'nine' has a high significance in the folk beliefs and mythology of Central Asian peoples. It was considered auspicious. </br>
Toguz Kumalak is played on a special board having two rows of 9 small pits and two big pits called Kazans. The player's side is the bottom row of the small pits and the player's kazan is the top one (close to the opponent's side). </br>
At the beginning of the game 9 seeds are placed in each small pit.</br>
